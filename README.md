# AoC_2025_FPGA_VHDL
For each day I will try and post a solution using vhdl first then in HardCaml then in Verilog (probably SystemVerilog, I don't know I've never used it before). The solutions will have test_benches attached,
so that a FPGA board is not required to see the solutions. Also, please commit any changes you think could optimize performance in terms of speed, memory, formatting, and other issues. 

## Day_1: Secret Entrance

RTL and Test_Bench attached will attach explain later
